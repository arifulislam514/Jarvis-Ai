Thousands of people have gathered in Dhaka for funeral prayers, and the government has organized a state funeral at the Parliament\u2011area venue on Manik\u202fMia Avenue.  \n\n- **Widespread protests and unrest** \u2013 Following Hadi\u2019s killing, large crowds have been chanting slogans and blocking Shahbagh Square. Demonstrators have set fire to several media offices and other buildings in the capital, and similar protests have spread to other cities. Security forces have been deployed to contain the demonstrations, and there have been reports of clashes with police.  \n\n- **Political tension ahead of the 2026 general election** \u2013 Interim leader **Muhammad\u202fYunus** (the Nobel\u2011Prize\u2011winning economist) used the occasion to criticize the previous administration, alleging that more than\u202f$230\u202fbillion vanished from government coffers during Prime Minister\u202fSheikh\u202fHasina\u2019s tenure. The next national election is expected in early\u202f2026, and political parties are positioning themselves for a contested transition.  \n\n- **International reactions** \u2013 India has partially suspended visas for Bangladeshi nationals, signalling concern over the escalating violence. The United Nations Secretary\u2011General Ant\u00f3nio\u202fGuterres condemned the killing of a Hindu man in Mymensingh and urged protection for minority communities.  \n\n- **Additional incidents** \u2013 Separate from the political unrest, an earthquake was felt in Dhaka on Friday, causing minor structural damage, and rescuers have been clearing debris from collapsed roofs.  \n\nIn summary, Bangladesh is experiencing a volatile mix of political protest, state mourning, and heightened security measures as the nation navigates the fallout from the recent assassination of a youth leader and prepares for upcoming elections."
